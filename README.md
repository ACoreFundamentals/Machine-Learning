# Welcome to AI Learn Fundamentals
# Who we are and why we are here?
AI Learn Fundamentals is a Program created with the sole purpose of simplifying Artificial intelligence concepts and most importantly to help anyone from beginners to experienced machine and deep learning experts, to develop and improve their skill in this field. We want to inspire you to do great with this with all that is available to us and ultimately create beyond realities limitations.
# Main Focus:
## **Artificial Intelligence fields**

* Machine learning
* Deep learning
* Computer vision

**Programming Language**

* Python

**We will use use a the frameworks**
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* Scikit learn
* PyTorch

**How we will learn**

We will go through the theory on how it works and why, then we procede to code implementaion and finally applying what we have learn to a real life problem using one of the framewoks.

* e.g, Each concept will have a 3 videos for Theory,Code and Application

Linear Regression
* The Theory behind Linear Regression
* The Code implementation of Linear Regression
* Applying Linear Regression to a Data set
* NOTE!! All code and Notes will be on github https://github.com/AILearnFundamentals

**Prerequisites**

Programming

*   Fair Understanding of Python

Third party libraries for data manipulation and visualization in Python
NOTE!! for these third party libraries prior familiarity and deep knowledge is not required, they are easy to pick up and you can       learn what you need only.

*   pandas - for data manipulation
*   numpy - for mathematical operations
*   matplotlib - data visualization

Mathematics

* Statistics
* Probability
* Calculus
* Linear Algebra

* Also Check our Youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUIK5-5A6XNHVWySmKt1-Ew

**Let's Start**

We will start with Machine Learning and Scikit Learn
Then we will explore Deep Learning with Tensorflow, Keras and PyTorch
After that we dive into computer vision and the Tools we will use are Python as a programming language, Tensorflow and **OPENCV**.
We are going to do a lot of projects, some of them from kaggle.
# **We are going to have a fun and a very productive journey together in AI Learn Fundamentals**
